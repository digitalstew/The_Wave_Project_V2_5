### The Wave Project V2.5
A small educational project concieved in order to learn the Processing 3  programming language.  

#### Learning Outcome:   
  Create a program that pulls data gathered from     
  an ocean buoy out in the Bearing Sea and display  
  that data to the user, both numerically and graphically.  
  - Numerical data is averaged.  
  - Graphical representations are approximate.  

#### Learning Objectives:  
1) Learn to write program in Processing 3.0  
2) Learn to pull data for the program from the Internet  
3) Learn to massage and display the data as information  
4) Learn to display information both numerically and graphically  
5) Learn to create a multi-pane data dashboard to show numeric and graphic data
